            <h2>My Dearest Motu,</h2>
            <p>A Very Happy 3rd Annaversary! 
                It all started on that one special day when I first saw you‚Äîmy Motu‚Äîroaming around Campus 6 with your friends. That was the moment I fell for you. I just couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off you. I wanted to talk to you, to know you, but you were busy‚Ä¶ washing clothes. LOL. But I guess fate had other plans because, somehow, we found our way to each other, thanks to all those little moments and the people who played even the smallest part in bringing us closer.
                
                From the first time we chatted, I was gone. I was completely head over heels for you. And even now, after all these years, I still don‚Äôt fully understand how you make me so happy. Even when we fight, even when we get mad at each other, there‚Äôs always something that pulls us back together‚Äîsomething much stronger than any argument or misunderstanding.
                
                You are the best Motu. You make me feel calm, you make me feel heard, and when I‚Äôm with you, the world just feels‚Ä¶ right. The comfort I get from you is something I can‚Äôt compare to anything else. Thank you for being with me through all these days, months, and years. Thank you for bearing my anger, my tantrums, my flaws. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. You make me feel complete.
                
                You always ask me why I love you. And honestly? I don‚Äôt even know how to put it into words. I just do. I love everything about you‚Äîyour looks, your eyes, your smile, your hair, your nose, your cheeks, your chotu height (LOL), your kindness, your dedication, and the quiet strength you carry for your family even when you don‚Äôt say a word about it. I see it all. I see you. And I love you for all that you are.
                
                It‚Äôs been three years now‚Äîthree years of love, fights, laughter, and growing together. Three years of "Us." And I wouldn‚Äôt trade a single moment of it. So here‚Äôs to us, to everything we‚Äôve built, and to everything that‚Äôs yet to come.
                
                I love you so, so much.
                Happy 3rd Anniversary, Nimilita. üíñ
                
                Forever yours,
                [KKS] ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
